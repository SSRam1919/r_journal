Core Technologies

Kotlin

Jetpack Compose (Material3)

Room Database

Compose Navigation

Coil (Image loading)

SwipeToDismiss (Material 1 inside M3 UI)

Coroutines + StateFlow

FileProvider for image access

🏛️ Data Model
ChatMessage.kt
data class ChatMessage(
    val id: String = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
    val role: String = "user",
    val content: String = "",
    val timestamp: Long = System.currentTimeMillis(),
    val imageUri: String? = null,
    val replyToMessageId: String? = null,
    val replyPreview: String? = null
)

JournalEntry.kt

One entry per day.

Stores a list of messages + mood tags.

💾 Room Storage
✔️ Custom JSON Converters

Your updated Converters.kt preserves all ChatMessage fields, including:

replyToMessageId

replyPreview

imageUri

This ensures reply chains survive app restarts.

🧠 ViewModel Logic (JournalViewModel)

Main responsibilities:

Load today’s entry

Load past entries

Add messages with/without images

Swipe-to-reply integration

Highlight target message on quote tap

Edit & delete rules only for today

Mood picker logic

Auto-sorting messages before saving

It exposes UI-ready state via:

currentEntry

isLoading: StateFlow<Boolean>

isMessageAddedLater(message)

isCurrentEntryToday

canEditMood

🖌️ UI Design
✔️ Modern Material 3

Rounded bubbles

Soft shadows

Smooth animations

✔️ WhatsApp-like Interaction Model

Swipe to reply

Tap reply preview → auto-scroll

Animated highlight

Long-press → Edit/Delete

Fade-in message animations

✔️ Optimized Layout

LazyColumn with stable keys

Auto-scroll to bottom on new message

Handles image height, full-width text wrapping

📸 Images & Media

Images are:

Compressed on save (max dimension = 1024px)

Stored privately

Previewed inline

Openable in full screen

🔁 Reply System (How It Works)
When swiping a message:
replyToMessage = message

When sending a message:
viewModel.addMessageWithImage(
    text,
    imageUri?.toString(),
    replyTo = replyToMessage
)

ViewModel stores:

replyToMessageId

replyPreview

UI displays:

A preview bubble above input box

A quoted bubble inside messages

Scroll-to-original on tap

👇 Highlight Logic

When a reply quote is tapped:

highlightedMessageId = originalMessage.id
delay(1500)
highlightedMessageId = null


Then:

isHighlighted = (message.id == highlightedMessageId)


In ChatBubble, border changes automatically.
